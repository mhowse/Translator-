# Translator-
A translation system, for translating text between german and english 

The original project in the small-projects repository grew too large to continue being called a small project. 
Between the current size, and estimated potential size, it was deemed prudent to shift the files into their own project. 
And thus, the Translation repository was created. 

Currently this translation project is working on a simple german -english text translation using a hash -table based spreadsheet system.
In the future there will be more spreadsheets allowing for more directions of translation. 
And perhaps some enforcing of grammatical conventions to allow for more accurate translations then the mere word-for-word translation that currently occurs. 
Also to be worked on later once the current system is working, and the dictionary filled, is the changing of translation from individual words being input by users, to taking whole (if simple) sentances as user input, and then translating the word.
